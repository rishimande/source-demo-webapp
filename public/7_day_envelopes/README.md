# 7-Day Envelope Images

Place the 7-day envelope images generated from the Python analysis script in this directory.

## Expected File

The application expects the following image file:
- `compressed_fit_2025-05-14_to_2025-05-22.png`

This image should show:
- Red line: 7-day max envelope
- Green dots: Filtered peaks
- Blue line: Half-sine fit (7-day)
- Purple dashed line: Battery dip marker (if detected)

## Generating the Image

The image should be generated by running the Python analysis script on the heartbeat data, which will create the envelope visualization and save it to this directory.

The image corresponds to the 7-day window from May 14, 2025 to May 22, 2025.
